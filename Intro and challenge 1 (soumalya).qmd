# **Survival Analysis**

**What is Survival Analysis?**\
Survival analysis is a statistical method used to analyze **time-to-event** data. It helps answer questions like:

-   How long do patients survive after a treatment?

-   When do machines fail under different conditions?

-   What factors influence the time until an event occurs?

Survival analysis focuses on **time-to-event** data, where *Survival Time* refers to the duration until an event occurs (such as death in medical studies or machine failure in engineering). *Censoring* happens when the event isn't observedâ€”for example, if a patient leaves a study before completion or the study ends before all events occur. The *Kaplan-Meier Curve* visually represents how survival probability changes over time, helping compare groups (like treatment vs. control). The *Hazard Ratio* quantifies relative risk between groups, indicating whether one group experiences the event faster (e.g., a ratio \>1 means higher risk, while \<1 suggests protection). Together, these concepts enable researchers to analyze event timing, handle incomplete data, and assess risk differences statistically.

## Challenge 1

### Objective of Challenge 1:

The primary objectives of this analysis are threefold: first, to **estimate survival probabilities** over time using the Kaplan-Meier method, which calculates the likelihood of an event (such as death or failure) occurring at different time points while accounting for censored data. Second, to **compare survival outcomes between two distinct groups** (e.g., males vs. females, treated vs. untreated), visualizing differences through stratified Kaplan-Meier curves. Third, to **determine whether observed survival differences are statistically significant** using the log-rank test, which evaluates whether the survival distributions between groups diverge meaningfully (p-value \< 0.05 indicates significance). Together, these steps provide a robust framework to quantify and compare time-to-event outcomes in clinical, engineering, or social science research.
