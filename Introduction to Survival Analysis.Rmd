In this module, we’ll explore how to model time-to-event data using R. You’ll learn how to analyze and visualize a variety of methods to understand survival patterns — even when we don't have the complete data for every individual.

# **Objectives** 
The objective of this module is to provide an applied introduction to survival analysis using R. To complete this module, prior familiarity with R syntax and basic statistical concepts such as regression and probability, is expected.

# **What is Survival Analysis?**
Imagine you’re tracking patients in a clinical trial to see how long it takes for them to recover. Not all patients finish the study, and some will never experience the event (recovery) — that’s where survival analysis comes in!

Key Idea: Time-to-Event Data 
In survival analysis, we care not only about what happens, but **when** it happens.  

There are two ways to think about time in this framework:  
- **Points**: The exact time an event occurs (e.g., someone relapses, dies, or gets a job)  
- **Lines**: The duration from the start of observation until the event. This could be days, months, or even years.  

This structure makes survival analysis unique from other statistical models. It is built to handle **incomplete information** and **uncertain timing**.  

# **Key Concepts**  
- **Time to event**: How long it takes until something happens  
- **Censoring**: When the event is not observed, but the data is still usable  
- **Survival function**: Probability of surviving past time *t*  
- **Hazard function**: Instantaneous risk of the event occurring at time *t*  
- **Hazard ratio**: Compares the risk between two groups (e.g., treated vs control)  

# **Types of Censoring**  
Survival analysis handles incomplete data using the concept of **censoring**:  
![Censoring Example](https://webfocusinfocenter.informationbuilders.com/wfappent/TLs/TL_rstat/source/images/RStat_Censor.gif)

- **Right censoring (most common)**: The event hasn’t happened yet, and we don't know when (e.g., someone is still alive at study’s end)  
- **Left censoring**: The event has already occurred before observation started  
- **Interval censoring**: The event happened between two known time points  

# **A Bit of History**  
Survival analysis has deep historical roots. In 1662, **John Graunt** created one of the first **life tables** by analyzing London’s death records. His goal was to understand the patterns of mortality and lifespan — essentially starting the earliest form of population-based survival analysis.  

For centuries, survival analysis was primarily used to study death and mortality rates, especially in public health. In the last few decades, this method has grown beyond medicine.  

# **Core Functions**  
- **Survival Function** $S(t) = P(T > t)$:  
  Represents the probability that an event has **not** occurred by time *t*  

- **Hazard Function** $h(t)$:  
  Represents the **instantaneous rate** at which the event occurs at time *t*, given that the individual has survived up to that time  
  > "If someone has made it to time *t*, how likely are they to experience the event **right now**?"  

- **Hazard Ratio**  
  $$HR = \frac{\text{Hazard when } x = 1}{\text{Hazard when } x = 0}$$  
  Compares the risk between two groups  
  > Example: An HR = 2 means one group is **twice as likely** to experience the event at a given moment than another group.  

# **Why Not Traditional Models?**  
![Traditional Models like linear regression assume:](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/probability.png)

- Every individual has a known outcome  
- No one drops out  
- The timing of events isn’t important  

But in the **real world**:  
- Not everyone reaches the event  
- People drop out  
- Timing matters  

Survival analysis is **designed** for real-world situations!  

# **Useful Skills You’ll Learn Today**  
We will apply survival analysis techniques to five challenges using data from the `survival` package in R, including:  
- **Kaplan-Meier Estimation**  
- **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**  
- **Time-Varying Covariates**  
- **Group comparison**  
- **Checking the Proportional Hazards Assumption**  

# **Conclusion**  
Survival analysis is a powerful tool for studying the timing of events, especially when dealing with incomplete or censored data.  
In this module, you’ve learned how to apply key survival analysis techniques in R, including the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards model. These methods are essential for analyzing real-world data where timing matters.  

By the end, you should feel more confident working with time-to-event data, interpreting survival curves, comparing groups, and understanding how risk changes over time.
