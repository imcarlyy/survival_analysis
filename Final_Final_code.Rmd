In this module, we’ll explore how to model time-to-event data using R.
You’ll learn how to analyze and visualize a variety of methods to
understand survival patterns — even when we don't have the complete data
for every individual.

## **Objectives**

The objective of this module is to provide an applied introduction to
survival analysis using R. To complete this module, prior familiarity
with R syntax and basic statistical concepts such as regression and
probability, is expected.

## **What is Survival Analysis?**

Imagine you’re tracking patients in a clinical trial to see how long it
takes for them to recover. Not all patients finish the study, and some
will never experience the event (recovery) — that’s where survival
analysis comes in!

Key Idea: Time-to-Event Data In survival analysis, we care not only
about what happens, but **when** it happens.

There are two ways to think about time in this framework:\
- **Points**: The exact time an event occurs (e.g., someone relapses,
dies, or gets a job)\
- **Lines**: The duration from the start of observation until the event.
This could be days, months, or even years.

This structure makes survival analysis unique from other statistical
models. It is built to handle **incomplete information** and **uncertain
timing**.

## **Key Concepts**

-   **Time to event**: How long it takes until something happens\
-   **Censoring**: When the event is not observed, but the data is still
    usable\
-   **Survival function**: Probability of surviving past time *t*\
-   **Hazard function**: Instantaneous risk of the event occurring at
    time *t*\
-   **Hazard ratio**: Compares the risk between two groups (e.g.,
    treated vs control)

## **Types of Censoring**

Survival analysis handles incomplete data using the concept of
**censoring**:\
![Censoring
Example](https://webfocusinfocenter.informationbuilders.com/wfappent/TLs/TL_rstat/source/images/RStat_Censor.gif)

-   **Right censoring (most common)**: The event hasn’t happened yet,
    and we don't know when (e.g., someone is still alive at study’s
    end)\
-   **Left censoring**: The event has already occurred before
    observation started\
-   **Interval censoring**: The event happened between two known time
    points

## **A Bit of History**

Survival analysis has deep historical roots. In 1662, **John Graunt**
created one of the first **life tables** by analyzing London’s death
records. His goal was to understand the patterns of mortality and
lifespan — essentially starting the earliest form of population-based
survival analysis.

For centuries, survival analysis was primarily used to study death and
mortality rates, especially in public health. In the last few decades,
this method has grown beyond medicine.

## **Core Functions**

-   **Survival Function** $S(t) = P(T > t)$:\
    Represents the probability that an event has **not** occurred by
    time *t*

-   **Hazard Function** $h(t)$:\
    Represents the **instantaneous rate** at which the event occurs at
    time *t*, given that the individual has survived up to that time\
    \> "If someone has made it to time *t*, how likely are they to
    experience the event **right now**?"

-   **Hazard Ratio**\
    $$HR = \frac{\text{Hazard when } x = 1}{\text{Hazard when } x = 0}$$\
    Compares the risk between two groups\
    \> Example: An HR = 2 means one group is **twice as likely** to
    experience the event at a given moment than another group.

## **Why Not Traditional Models?**

![Traditional Models like linear regression
assume:](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/probability.png)

-   Every individual has a known outcome\
-   No one drops out\
-   The timing of events isn’t important

But in the **real world**:\
- Not everyone reaches the event\
- People drop out\
- Timing matters

Survival analysis is **designed** for real-world situations!

## **Useful Skills You’ll Learn Today**

We will apply survival analysis techniques to five challenges using data
from the `survival` package in R, including:\
- **Kaplan-Meier Estimation**\
- **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**\
- **Time-Varying Covariates**\
- **Group comparison**\
- **evaluating average survival curves across different modeling
frameworks**

## **Using R for survival analysis**

In this module, we'll be applying survival techniques using R. We'll
focus on key functions such as:

-   **survfit():** Estmates survival functions and generates
    Kaplan-Meier curves.

-   **coxph():** Fits the Cox proportional hazards model to analyze the
    effects of covariates on survival

These functions allow us to analyze time-to-event data and assess the
effects of different variables on survival outcomes.

# **Let's begin:**

## **Challenge 1**

### Fitting the Kaplan-Meier Survival Model

The **Kaplan–Meier estimator**, also known as the **product limit
estimator**, is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival
function from lifetime data. In medical research, it is often used to
measure the fraction of patients living for a certain amount of time
after treatment. In other fields, Kaplan–Meier estimators may be used to
measure the length of time people remain unemployed after a job loss,
the time-to-failure of machine parts, or in our case, the amount of time
a patient survived after being diagnosed for a disease.

For this challenge, we will start with a basic dataset of twelve Colon
cancer patients in a study who have survived after diagnosis.

We will now read the dataset (Csurv) which I prepared specially for this
challenge:

```{r}
library(readxl)

github_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imcarlyy/survival_analysis/main/Csurv.xlsx"
temp_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")  # Create a temporary file
download.file(github_url, temp_file, mode = "wb")  # 'wb' for binary (Excel files)
Csurv <- read_excel(temp_file)  # Read the downloaded file
unlink(temp_file)  # Delete the temporary file
```

Now I will check the names of the variables given in this table.

```{r}
names(Csurv)
```

```{r}
attach(Csurv) #Since, the dataset is small (n=12) we can take a look at it entirely here:
Csurv
```

It is very important to know while working with survival analysis
datasets what the 0 and 1 stands for.

In this example we are considering Death: 1=event has occurred (death)
and 0=no event (they are censored; meaning they have left the study and
hence we do not know whether they have data on them at the given point
of time).

So, in this dataset if we look at first column, the 1st individual died
at 2 months from the start of the study (Time=2, Death=1), the 2nd
individual was censored at 3 months (Time=3, Death=0), the 3rd
individual died at 6 months (Time=6, Death=1) and so on.

Now we will look into the Kaplan-Meier to fit into this dataset.

In order to do this, we need to load the survival library into R. Now,
the survival library is already built into base R, so we do not need to
install this package, but we do need to load the package to use these
survival commands.

```{r}
library(survival)
```

Now in order the fit the K-M model, we will use this survfit command and
so I am going to fit a survival analysis, store it in an object called
km.model:

```{r}
km.model<-survfit(Surv(Time, Death)~1, type="kaplan-meier")
```

Here, I am going to let R know the type is kaplan-meier (if we do not
specify the type it will fit the kaplan-meier by default so it wouldn't
have been an issue)

Now the way we specify the survival time or the y variable is using a
capital S; so it's Surv (survival) and then in parentheses we need to
give it both the time the individual was followed for as well the
indicator of whether the event occured (they died) or if they were
censored {*Surv(Time, Death)* tilde 1} and the reason we have one here
is that for this dataset we don't actually have any x variables. This is
the way we let R know that we are just estimating survival without using
any particular X variables.

Now that the model has been fit, we can ask a few summaries...

```{r}
km.model #Summary of the K-M model
```

The output we are getting here is the total number of individuals is 12,
number of events is 10 (10 deaths and 2 censored observations), median
survival time so, in this case half the people survived beyond 15
months, half did not. We have also returned a 95% confidence interval
for the median which means that we are 95% confident that median
survival is somewhere between 7 months and infinity. This dataset is
very small so here we do not have a upper limit for confidence interval
around the median survival.

We can also ask for the summary of the model:

```{r}
summary(km.model)
```

Here we can see that at time 2, there were 12 individuals at risk, 1
death occurred, the probability of surviving beyond 2 months is 91.7%.
We also have a standard error associated with that survival (0.0798) as
well as a 95% CI (ie. we are 95% confident that beyond 2 months the
patients survival chances are between 77.3% upto a 100%). Similary, at
time 6, there are 10 individuals at risk, 2 individuals died and so the
probabilty of surviving beyond 6 months is 73.3%. Again, the standard
error at 6 months is 0.1324 and we are 95% confident that there's
somewhere between 51.5 upto 100% chance of surviving 6 months. Now these
are extremely wide confidence intervals because the sample size is so
small. This dataset is useful for introducing the idea of Kaplan-Meier
survival model but for a real study, we would have a same size of much
greater than 12.

Now we can ask R to make a plot of this model. To do that we can ask R
to plot the K-M model. So R will plot the Kaplan-Meier model that was
fit saying confidence interval=F (or False). It tells R to not put a
confidence interval around the survival function. xlab and ylab are
giving the plot x-axis and y-axis labels and the main is the title.

```{r}
plot(km.model, conf.int=F, xlab="Time (months)",ylab="%Alive = S(t)", main="K-M Model")
```

As we can see, a plot of the Kaplan–Meier is a series of declining
horizontal steps.

Now if we wanted to we can ask R to put confidence interval or
confidence bands around this survival function. To do so we would just
set conf.int=T (or True). I will also set las=1 (this will rotate the
values on the y-axis. So, here's what it will look like:

```{r}
plot(km.model, conf.int=T, xlab="Time (months)", ylab="%Alive = S(t)", main="K-M Model", las=1)
```

We can see now these dashed lines give us confidence interval around the
survival function and we can also see that las = 1 argument rotated the
values on y-axis.

Now I am going to add a red horizontal line at S(t) = 50% into this
plot:

```{r}
plot(km.model, conf.int=T, xlab="Time (months)", ylab="%Alive = S(t)", main="K-M Model", las=1)
abline(h=0.5, col="red")
```

The red line is at 50% meaning 50% surviving 50% not. Hence, this is how
we look at the median survival. Here the red line crosses the survival
function right at the 15 months (this is our median). The red line
passes the dashed line for lower limit at 7 months and it never hits the
dashed line for upper limit (because of the smaller sample size).

Now, I am going to produce the same plot again but added mark.time=TRUE
and this will add in little tick marks wherever there was a censored
observation. So if you remember there was observations censored at 3 and
at 10 months. So, here's the code:

```{r}
plot(km.model, conf.int=T, xlab="Time (months)", ylab="%Alive = S(t)", main="K-M Model", las=1, mark.time=TRUE)
```

This helps us visualize where and when observations are censored.

Now, let's include a x variable into fitting this model. I will continue
on the same cancer patient dataset (those 12 individuals were all under
40 years old) and will add in more data points and this is going to be a
group of individuals who are over 40 years old (another column Over40
will be added)

```{r}
rm(Csurv)
library(readxl)

github_url2 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imcarlyy/survival_analysis/main/Csurv40.xlsx"
temp_file2 <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")  # Creates a temporary file path
download.file(github_url2, temp_file2, mode = "wb")  # Saves to temp_file2 (not temp_file)
Csurv40 <- read_excel(temp_file2)  # Reads from temp_file2
unlink(temp_file2)  # Deletes temp_file2
```

Taking a quick look at the new table:

```{r}
head(Csurv40)
```

```{r}
tail(Csurv40)
```

Over40=0 : not over 40 years old; Over40=1: Over 40 years old

Now let's fit the K-M Model (say km.model2), relating over/under40 to
survival and see if there is a relationship between survival and age:

```{r}
km.model2<-survfit(Surv(Time, Death)~Over40, type="kaplan-meier", data=Csurv40)
```

Plotting this:

```{r}
plot(km.model2, conf.int=F, xlab="Time (months)", ylab="%Alive = S(t)", main="K-M Model", data=Csurv40) #conf.int=F, so we will not put the confidence bands on there for now.
```

As we can see, we clearly see a difference between under 40 and over 40
groups: Under 40 groups have a higher chance of survival than over 40
groups.

Let's do some summaries:

```{r}
summary(km.model2)
```

```{r}
km.model2
```

Now, let's make that same plot again but adding some colours, a legend
and a tick at the time of censored events:

```{r}
plot(km.model2, conf.int=F, xlab="Time (months)", ylab="%Alive = S(t)", main="K-M Model", col=c("red","blue"), las=1, lwd=2, mark.time=TRUE, data=Csurv40 )

legend(18, 0.95, legend=c("Under 40 years", "Over 40 years"), lty=1, lwd=2, col=c("red", "blue"), bty="",cex=0.6) #adding a legend
```

An important question:

Are two survival functions are statistically significantly different? Or
do you think that the survival differs if someone is over or under 40?

YES! Survival (Probability of surviving beyond a certain time) changes
depending on if someone's over or under 40. Here I will talk about the
formal test for doing this.

Here comes the **Log-Rank Test**: It is a way of testing if there is a
significant difference between the two survival curve. It is also known
as the Mantle Hansel test.

```{r}
#Log-Rank Test
#Null Hypothesis: Survival for two groups is same
#Hypothesis1: Survival for two groups is not same
survdiff(Surv(Time, Death)~Over40, data=Csurv40)
```

Test-statistic is 4.8, the p-value is 0.03. Based on this small p-value,
we can reject our null hypothesis. We have evidence to believe that
survival is not the same depending on if you are over or under 40.

## **Challenge 2:**

### Cox proportional hazard model: Checking the proportional hazards assumption

```{r}
library(survival)
library(survminer)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

Let's say you want to assess the role of different variables in your
data in survival times. There are many models and methods to do so but
the most common is to use the Cox Proportional Hazard model. First
introduced in 1972, this model allows you to assess the hazard at a
certain time given a specific covariate. In math terms, under the cox
model our hazard function is:

![](cox_hazard_function.png) Where the hazard at time t given your
covariate X is equal to your baseline hazard function (with all
covariates equal to 0), multiplied by your exponential function exp(BX),
a multiplicative way of assessing the covariates influence on overall
hazard.

Let's load in our datasets.

```{r}
data(cancer)
```

As before we'll make a survival object based on some of our data. In
this case let's use the lung cancer survival dataset:

```{r}
sv1 <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung)
```

The Survival package makes fitting a CPH model to your data very easy,
with just the coxph function. Say we wanted to fit a Cox regression
based on age to our cancer mortality data:

```{r}
cx_age <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ age, data = lung)
cx_age
```

However, the CPH model makes some assumptions!

1.  The covariates that you're testing are constant over time.

2.  Hazard ratios/proportions do not vary over time.

The second one is the most important. Put simply it means that the
proportion of hazard between groups in your model is the same at every
time point. This is referred to as the "proportional hazards assumption"
and is the reason it's called the Cox *Proportional Hazard* model. This
limits the model's utility, and means that we need to test to see if our
data can be used with the cox model. Luckily the survival package makes
this pretty straightforward using the cox.zph() function:

```{r}
cox.zph(cx_age)
```

The function returns a p value of 0.56, which is far above even our
least stringent alpha levels so we can be pretty confident that our age
data does not violate the proportional hazard assumption. Hooray!

Let's have a look at our cox model based on age again:

```{r}
cx_age
```

The coefficient is positive, so we're seeing a slight increase in the
risk of an "event" (in this case death) due to age, with a significant
p-value of 0.0419. Though note that this p-value is on the higher end,
so we might want to take this result with a grain of salt.

### Try it on your own!

Fit a CPH model to the cancer data, looking at sex in addition to age.
Does our model using sex violate the proportional hazard assumption? How
does it's p-value compare to that of age? What might account for this?

```{r}
cx_sex <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + age, data = lung)
cox.zph(cx_sex)
```

```{r}
cx_sex
```

Curiously, sex is showing a strong negative coefficient, indicating that
it's having a strong protective effect (i.e. females are surviving
longer than males in this dataset), and our p-value for that is 0.002,
which is significant by most metrics! That said, if we look at the cox
proportional hazard assumption test our p-value associated with sex is
pretty low, at 0.11. This is a little concerning, since while we're
still technically above an alpha threshold of 0.05, we might be
concerned that our sex covariate is violating the proportional hazard
assumption. What do our survival curves look like?

```{r}
plot_1 <- ggsurvplot(
  survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung),
  legend.labs = c("Male", "Female"),
  palette = c("purple","forestgreen"),
  conf.int = T
  )
plot_1
```

Hmm, our survival plots seem to be drawing together towards the end of
the timeframe we're looking at. Perhaps that accounts for the low
p-value in our proportional hazard test. What happens if we remove the
individuals near the ends of the curves?

```{r}
lung_short <- lung %>% 
  filter(
    time < 700
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    time > 50
  )
cx_sex2 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + age, data = lung_short)
cox.zph(cx_sex2)
```

```{r}
ggsurvplot(
  survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung_short),
  legend.labs = c("Male", "Female"),
  palette = c("purple","forestgreen"),
  conf.int = T
  )
```

Ahh, interesting! If we omit the mortality events that occurred very
early and very late in our time series data, the proportional hazard due
to our sex variable becomes a lot more constant. Interestingly doing
this also seems to drop our age p-value, but both are now far above what
we would consider a significant violation of the proportional hazard
assumption.

## **Challenge 3:**

Now let's try what we've learned with some other data sets. Have a look
at the colon dataset provided by the survival package. This is a
survival dataset for patients with colon cancer in a chemotherapy
treatment trial, with the "rx" column indicating what treatment the
patients received (either "Obs" for observation only, "rxLev" for
treatment with just levamisole, or "rxLev + 5FU" for levamisole & the
chemotherapy agent 5-FU). Does the rx covariate violate the proportional
hazard assumption? What do the survival curves look like for this data
when we segregate based on treatment? Does the chemotherapy seem to
work?

```{r}
head(colon)
```

```{r}
ggsurvplot(
  survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = colon),
  conf.int = T
  )
```

```{r}
colon_cox <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ rx, data = colon)
cox.zph(colon_cox)
```

```{r}
colon_cox
```

```{r}
ggsurvplot(
  survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ rx, data = colon),
  conf.int = T,
  pval = T,
  pval.method = T
  )
```

## **Challenge 4:**

One of the most common test in survival analysis is a nonparametric test
known as **log-rank test,** which compares survival curves under the
assumption of **proportional hazards**. It tests whether there is a
**statistically significant difference** in survival between groups over
time.

$H_0: S_1(t) = S_2(t) \text{ for all } t$

$H_A: S_1(t) \neq S_2(t) \text{ for some } t$

The null hypothesis states that **survival functions** $S_1(t)$ and
$S_2(t)$ for the two groups are **equal at all time points** $t$**,**
there is **no difference in survival** between groups over time. While
the alternative hypothesis states that the **survival functions** are
**not equal at some time point** $t$, so there is **a difference** in
survival between the two groups.

How the log-rank test works is that is compares the **observed** number
of events (e.g., deaths) in each group to the expected number under the
assumptions that all group have the same survival experience. So it sums
the differences over the entire study period.

$X^2 = \frac{(O_1 - E_1)^2}{V_1}$

Where:

-   $O_1$ is the observed number of events in group 1

-   $E_1$ is the expected number of events in group 1

-   $V_1$ is the variance of difference

-   This statistic follows the chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of
    freedom

In R, we will be using the `survdiff()` function from the `{survival}`
package to perform comparisons between two groups.

Lets first compare survival times between males and females in the
`Lung` dataset to help us answer the question:

-   Is there a statistically significant difference in survival times
    between males and females?

```{r}
head(lung) #Display the first 6 rows of the lung dataset
```

Lets check if the survival curves follow the proportion hazard
assumptions.

```{r}
# Fit a Cox Proportional Hazards model
cox_m1 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)

# Test proportional hazards assumption
cox_t1 <- cox.zph(cox_m1)

# View the results
cox_t1
```

The p-value for sex is greater than 0.05, then there is no evidence that
proportional hazards assumption is violated for sex. Then we can move
forward to perform the log-rank test between males and females.

```{r}
# Convert sex to a factor with appropriate labels
lung$sex <- factor(lung$sex, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Male", "Female"))

# Fit the Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves
fit1 <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)

# View the summary of the survival curves
summary(fit1)
```

The `summary(fit)` tells us how the survival probabilities change over
time for each male and female. Lets use our Kaplan-Meier survival curve
from **Challenge 2** to visual the summary.

```{r}
# Dervived from Challenge 2
plot_1
```

We can see that the female survival curve in the `lung` dataset have a
higher survival probability as time progresses compared to the male.
This suggests that females tend to live longer than males in the study.
However, how do we know this difference is significant? We will perform
our **log-rank test** using `survdiff()` function from the `{survival}`
to compare the survival curves of females and males

```{r}
# Log-Rank Test
logrank_test <- survdiff(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)
logrank_test
```

We reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is less than 0.05
significance level (p = 0.001). There is sufficient enough evidence to
support that there is a statistically significant difference in survival
times between males and females in the `lung` dataset.

Next, let's try to to fit a Cox Proportional model using Karnofsky
performance score rated by physicians (ph.karno) as our predictor.

How do the levels of performance rated by physicians compare to survival
rate?

First we would have to factor ph.karno into different levels (Low,
Medium, High) to compare it to the survival rates. Then, we perform our
Cox Proportional model:

```{r}
# Splitting the ph.Karno into different groups
lung$karno_group <- cut(lung$ph.karno, breaks = c(0, 50, 75, 100), labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))

# Cox Model with time-varying effect
cox_m2 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ lung$karno_group, data = lung)

# Check the proportional hazards assumption
cox.zph(cox_m2)
```

We see that we violate the proportional hazard assumptions because our
p-value is less than the 0.05.

So what happens if we violate the proportional hazards assumption?

When we violate the proportion hazard assumption, it means the
relationship between a covariate and the hazard rate is not constant
over time. So the effect of that variable on survival changes as time
progresses.

The Cox Proportional Hazard model assumes that hazard ratios between
groups are proportional and do not change over time. If this assumption
is violated, the model may produce biased or misleading results.

A common solution is to include time-varying covariates like we learned
in challenge 3 to help us model the effects changed over time.

In the lung dataset, a time-varying covariate would be weight loss
(wt.loss) which we can use to model with the variable ph.karno (since
this alone violate the assumptions).

```{r}
# Cox Proportional Model
cox_m3 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ karno_group + wt.loss, data = lung)

# Checking assumptions 
cox.zph(cox_m3)
```

After adding the time-varying co-variate of weight loss in the last 6
months, we see that the karno_group no longer violates the assumptions
of proportional hazard model. However, because karno_group alone
violates the proportional hazard assumptions we cannot perform a
log-rank test. We would have to use more complex test such as a
stratified or weighted log-rank test.

## **Challenge 5:**

### Average Survival Curves: Comparison of Modeling Frameworks

In previous challenges, we used the Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH)
model to assess how variables like sex influence survival time. However,
CoxPH assumes a single type of event (for example, death), and it does
not account for different causes of death or event types. However, in
real-life scenarios, like the lung dataset, patients can die from
various causes, some of which might prevent other events from occurring.
These are called competing risks. But why compare CoxPH and CRR? The Cox
Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) model is the go-to tool in many survival
analyses. It’s powerful for understanding how covariates like age or sex
influence risk over time — but it doesn’t account for competing events.

Now, imagine a patient could die from multiple causes (e.g., cancer vs.
heart disease), and we're only interested in one of them. If we just use
CoxPH, we treat other causes of death like they never happened (we
censor them), which can overestimate the probability of the event we're
focused on. That’s where the Competing Risks Regression (CRR) model
steps in.

Overall, comparing CoxPH and CRR matters because:

1)  They both are made to achieve different goals: CoxPH estimates
    relative risk (hazard ratios), but CRR gives us actual event
    probabilities (cumulative incidence) in the presence of competing
    risks.

2)  They are used for different interpretations: CoxPH tells us "How
    much more (or less) likely is someone to experience the event if it
    happens?" while CRR answers "What’s the actual chance of this
    specific event happening over time?"

3)  We use them to make different assumptions: CoxPH assumes that the
    hazard ratio is constant (proportional hazards), and doesn’t
    distinguish between causes. CRR handles competing events directly,
    modeling the risk of one outcome in the context of others.

4)  They could show us different curves: CoxPH-based survival curves may
    overpredict event probabilities when competing risks are present.
    CRR-based cumulative incidence functions are more realistic when
    there are multiple possible outcomes.

Having examined the strenghts and weaknesses of the Cox Proportional
Hazards (CoxPH) model, we will now explore how it compares to the
Competing Risks Regression (CRR) model.

In this challenge, we'll simulate competing risks using the weight loss
variable as an indicator for increased risk of death from causes other
than cancer. This will give us a more realistic understanding of
survival curves and competing risks.

We’ll continue using the lung dataset and compare survival curves for
sex, just like in Challenge 4, but this time we’ll simulate a competing
event based on weight loss.

Step 1: We will begin loading our necessary packages:

```{r}

library(cmprsk)  # For competing risks regression
library(dplyr)   # For data wrangling
library(ggplot2) # For visualization
```

Step 2: We will prepare the Lung dataset. Make sure the sex variable is
treated as a factor (which it should be already, but just to be safe,
we'll do it here).

```{r}
# Ensure 'sex' is a factor (in case it’s not already)
str(lung)

# Check the weight loss data
summary(lung$wt.loss)
```

Step 3: We will simulate competing risks based on weight loss

We'll create a competing risks variable (called cr_status) based on
weight loss. The idea is that significant weight loss may be an
indicator of more severe health decline, increasing the likelihood of
death from other causes like cardiovascular issues or infection.

For this challenge, we'll assume that wt.loss \> 5 kg correlates with a
higher risk of death from other causes. We'll simulate a second event
(competing risk) for patients who meet this threshold.

So... Let's imagine that we have a group of lung cancer patients, and we
notice that those who lose more than 5 kg of weight over the course of
their illness are at a significantly higher risk of death from
complications like infections or heart disease. This competing risk
could potentially bias our CoxPH model, which we’ll compare against the
CRR model.

This is how it would like in our code:

```{r}
# Simulate a competing risk based on weight loss (wt.loss > 5 kg means a higher risk of death from other causes)
lung$cr_status <- ifelse(lung$wt.loss > 5, 
                          sample(c(1, 2), size = nrow(lung), replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.7, 0.3)),
                          0)

# Check the distribution of the new competing risk status
table(lung$cr_status)
```

Here, we: Assign 1 for death from cancer (event of interest).

Assign 2 for death from another cause (competing event).

Assign 0 for censored data (patients still alive or lost to follow-up).

Step 4: We will be using the Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) Model from
Challenge 4 which was using sex as a predictor for survival and the
survival plot from Challenge 2 comparing the male & female survival
curves. The CoxPH model will treat competing events as censored data
(which is its limitation)

```{r}
# Fit a Cox Proportional Hazards model using 'sex' as the predictor from Challenge 4
summary(cox_m1)

# Using Challenge 2 survival curves for male vs female
plot_1
```

This gives us the survival curves for male and female patients under the
CoxPH model, where the competing risk is simply ignored (patients who
die from other causes are treated as censored).

Step 5: Fitting a Competing Risks Regression (CRR) Model Now, we’ll fit
the CRR model (Fine and Gray method) using the newly created competing
risk variable (cr_status). This model explicitly accounts for the
competing risk and helps us understand how survival probabilities change
when competing risks are considered.

```{r}
# Fit a Competing Risks Regression model using Fine and Gray's method
crr_model <- with(lung, crr(ftime = time, fstatus = cr_status, cov1 = model.matrix(~ sex)[, -1]))
summary(crr_model)

# Plot the cumulative incidence curves (CRR model)
cif <- with(lung, cuminc(ftime = time, fstatus = cr_status, group = sex))

# Plot the cumulative incidence curves
plot(cif, xlab = "Time (Days)", ylab = "Cumulative Incidence",
     main = "CRR Model: Cumulative Incidence by Sex",
     col = c("blue", "red"))
legend("bottomright", legend = names(cif), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1)

```

This will generate cumulative incidence functions (CIF), which show the
probability of death from cancer (the event of interest) and death from
other causes (competing event) over time, adjusted for sex.

So, we comparing our models. What difference have we seen?

The CoxPH model treats competing events as censored, which can lead to
overestimations of survival probabilities in the presence of competing
risks.

The CRR model explicitly accounts for competing risks, giving a more
realistic picture of survival probabilities when studying specific
causes of death.

# **Conclusion:**

Survival analysis is a powerful tool for studying the timing of events,
especially when dealing with incomplete or censored data.\
In this module, you’ve learned how to apply key survival analysis
techniques in R, including the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox
proportional hazards model. These methods are essential for analyzing
real-world data where timing matters.

By the end, you should feel more confident working with time-to-event
data, interpreting survival curves, comparing groups, and understanding
how risk changes over time.
